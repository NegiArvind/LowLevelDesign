Design Dispute Management System in java where users could raise disputes like GOLD, MUTUAL FUND, or PAYMENT related issues.
The goal was to make sure each dispute got assigned to an agent who really knew their stuff for that specific dispute type.

What made it interesting was figuring out how to always send the dispute to the least busy agent with the right expertise, 
so the workload was balanced fairly. Plus, the system needed to be flexible enough so that later on, they could easily 
add new ways to assign disputes if needed.
